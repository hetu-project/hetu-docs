## Hetu Chain
Hetu Chain is a blockchain optimized for specific application scenarios, focusing on high performance, customized functionalities, and cross-chain interoperability. Unlike general-purpose blockchains such as Ethereum, application chains achieve efficient operation through the following features:

- Vertical Optimization: Tailored consensus mechanisms and transaction processing logic for third-party integrations such as AI agents.
- Native Cross-Chain Support: Built-in asset bridging tools for seamless connectivity with major public chains like Ethereum.
- Hybrid Economic Model: Allows simultaneous use of ETH and native tokens for network participation.
  
## Ecosystem Architecture and Role Division

### Layered Design
- **Ethereum (Security Layer)**: Serves as the foundational security anchor of the ecosystem, ensuring trust infrastructure.
- **Hetu Chain (Consensus Layer)**: Acts as the central hub, coordinating a shared validator network and providing unified consensus security and service orchestration for upper-layer application chains.
- **APP Chain (Application Layer)**: Vertical scenario-specific chains built by third-party developers using Hetu's technology stack, focusing on business logic without the need to maintain independent node networks.

### Collaboration Relationships
- **Asset Flow**: Users lock assets through Ethereum. After Hetu Chain verifies cross-chain operations, APP Chains generate corresponding on-chain assets for business scenarios.
- **Security Sharing**: All APP Chains share Hetu Chain's validator set, ensuring network security through unified staking and penalty mechanisms, avoiding redundant infrastructure costs.
- **State Synchronization**: Critical transaction data is aggregated and signed by Hetu Chain, then periodically anchored to Ethereum, ensuring multi-chain state consistency.

## Core Advantages

### Efficient Development
- **Modular Architecture**: APP Chain developers only need to focus on business logic, as Hetu Chain provides foundational chain functionalities (consensus, cross-chain, node management, etc.).
- **Plug-and-Play Tools**: Built-in services like asset bridges, governance templates, and data indexing reduce development barriers by 80%.

### Low-Cost Operation
- **Shared Security**: No need to build independent validator networks, directly leveraging Hetu Chain's node resources reduces security costs by 70%.
- **Unified Liquidity**: Standardized cross-chain protocols between Hetu Chain and Ethereum enable seamless asset flow within the ecosystem.

### Optimized User Experience
- **Single-Point Interaction**: Users can manage multi-chain assets through a single wallet, with cross-chain operations simplified to "one-click confirmation".
- **User Convenience**: Gas fees support ETH payments, providing user-friendly transaction experiences.
