# Staking & Delegation

This document describes the staking and delegation mechanisms in the Hetu Protocol.

## Overview

Staking is a fundamental mechanism in the Hetu Protocol that allows token holders to participate in network security and governance. By staking HETU tokens, users can:

- Secure the network
- Earn rewards
- Participate in governance decisions

## Staking Process

*Detailed staking process will be documented here.*

## Delegation

Delegation allows HETU token holders to delegate their staking power to validators without transferring ownership of their tokens. This enables participation in network consensus and rewards earning without running validator infrastructure.

## Rewards

Staking and delegation rewards are distributed according to the economic model described in the [Economic Model](./04-06-Economic-Model.md) document.

## Unbonding Period

When unstaking or undelegating tokens, users must wait through an unbonding period before their tokens become liquid again. This security measure prevents certain types of attacks on the network.

## Slashing

Validators who misbehave or fail to meet performance requirements may be subject to slashing, where a portion of their staked tokens (and those of their delegators) are forfeited.

*More details on slashing conditions and amounts will be added.*
