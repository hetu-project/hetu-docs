# Hetu Checkpoint

Hetu Checkpoint is a secure and efficient checkpointing system that leverages Distributed Key Generation (DKG) and BLS signatures to prevent long-range attacks on blockchain networks.

## Overview

Hetu Checkpoint creates secure checkpoints for multiple blocks using a network of validators. These checkpoints are then anchored to Ethereum, providing an additional layer of security and finality.

## Key Features

- **Epoch-based Checkpointing**: Divides blockchain into epochs with fixed validator sets
- **DKG Integration**: Secure distributed key generation for validator coordination
- **BLS Signatures**: Efficient aggregated signatures for checkpoint creation
- **Ethereum Anchoring**: Checkpoint hashes are recorded on Ethereum
- **Long-range Attack Prevention**: Enhanced security through periodic checkpointing
