# Understanding Hetu Subnets

## Overview

Hetu subnets are specialized, autonomous communities within the Hetu network, each focused on producing specific types of digital commodities. Each subnet operates as an independent economy with its own rules, participants, and reward mechanisms.

## What is a Subnet?

A subnet is:
- **Autonomous Community**: Self-governing ecosystem with specialized focus
- **Economic Unit**: Independent economy with custom incentive mechanisms  
- **Innovation Platform**: Space for experimenting with new digital commodity markets
- **Value Generator**: Produces specific digital commodities for the broader network

## Subnet Components
- **Miners**: Produce the subnet's target digital commodities
- **Validators**: Evaluate and rank miner outputs for quality
- **Incentive Mechanism**: Rules governing reward distribution
- **Governance Structure**: Decision-making processes for subnet evolution

## Creating Your Own Subnet

### Prerequisites
- Clear vision for a specific digital commodity or service
- Understanding of target market demand and competition
- Technical capability to implement subnet protocols
- Community of potential participants (miners and validators)

### Basic Steps
1. **Concept Development**: Define your subnet's purpose, target commodity, and value proposition
2. **Technical Design**: Specify how miners will work and validators will evaluate outputs
3. **Economic Modeling**: Design sustainable token economics and incentive structures
4. **Implementation**: Develop smart contracts and necessary software components
5. **Registration**: Register your subnet with the Hetu network
6. **Launch**: Begin operations with initial community of participants

## Success Factors
- **Clear Value Proposition**: Solve a real problem or meet genuine market demand
- **Fair Incentives**: Ensure all participants benefit from subnet success
- **Technical Reliability**: Build robust, secure, and scalable systems
- **Active Community**: Foster engaged participation and governance

## Types of Subnets
- **Compute Subnets**: AI inference, model training, scientific computing
- **Data Subnets**: Storage networks, content delivery, data processing
- **Specialized Subnets**: Domain-specific services like financial prediction or research
