# Understanding Hetu Subnets

## Overview

Hetu subnets are specialized, autonomous communities within the Hetu network, each focused on producing specific types of digital commodities. Each subnet operates as an independent economy with its own rules, participants, and reward mechanisms.

## What is a Subnet?

A subnet is:

- **Autonomous Community**: Self-governing ecosystem with specialized focus
- **Economic Unit**: Independent economy with custom incentive mechanisms  
- **Innovation Platform**: Space for experimenting with new digital commodity markets
- **Value Generator**: Produces specific digital commodities for the broader network

---

## Subnet Components

- **Miners**: Produce the subnet's target digital commodities
- **Validators**: Evaluate and rank miner outputs for quality
- **Incentive Mechanism**: Rules governing reward distribution
- **Governance Structure**: Decision-making processes for subnet evolution

## Creating Your Own Subnet

### Prerequisites

- Clear vision for a specific digital commodity or service
- Understanding of target market demand and competition
- Technical capability to implement subnet protocols
- Community of potential participants (miners and validators)

### Basic Steps

1. **Concept Development**: Define your subnet's purpose, target commodity, and value proposition
2. **Technical Design**: Specify how miners will work and validators will evaluate outputs
3. **Economic Modeling**: Design sustainable token economics and incentive structures
4. **Implementation**: Develop smart contracts and necessary software components
5. **Registration**: Register your subnet with the Hetu network
6. **Launch**: Begin operations with initial community of participants

### Success Factors

- **Clear Value Proposition**: Solve a real problem or meet genuine market demand
- **Fair Incentives**: Ensure all participants benefit from subnet success
- **Technical Reliability**: Build robust, secure, and scalable systems
- **Active Community**: Foster engaged participation and governance

## Types of Subnets

- **Compute Subnets**: AI inference, model training, scientific computing
- **Data Subnets**: Storage networks, content delivery, data processing
- **Specialized Subnets**: Domain-specific services like financial prediction or research

## Mining

Miners produce valuable digital commodities and computational resources for the Hetu network. They are the backbone of the ecosystem, generating the actual value that drives the network's economy.

### Types of Mining

- **Compute Mining**: AI inference, model training, general computing
- **Storage Mining**: Data storage, content delivery, backup services  
- **Specialized Mining**: Protein folding, financial prediction, custom services

### How to Become a Miner

#### Prerequisites

- Suitable hardware (GPU, CPU, or storage depending on subnet type)
- Stable internet connection with adequate bandwidth
- Understanding of your chosen subnet's requirements

#### Basic Steps

1. **Choose Focus**: Select mining type and target subnet based on your resources
2. **Setup Hardware**: Prepare and optimize your mining equipment
3. **Install Software**: Install Hetu CLI and subnet-specific mining software
4. **Register Neuron**: Register your miner neuron on the network
5. **Start Mining**: Begin accepting tasks and producing digital commodities

### Mining Rewards

- Base rewards for completed mining tasks
- Quality bonuses for high-quality outputs
- Efficiency incentives for fast and reliable service
- Subnet-specific multipliers and bonuses

## Validator

Validators evaluate the quality and accuracy of miners' work in the Hetu network. They help maintain network integrity while earning rewards for honest and accurate assessments.

### How to Become a Validator

#### Prerequisites

- Sufficient Hetu tokens for staking requirements
- Reliable hardware with stable internet connection
- Technical knowledge of the target subnet's validation criteria

#### Basic Steps

1. **Setup Environment**: Install Hetu CLI and configure your wallet
2. **Register Neuron**: Register your validator neuron on the network
3. **Choose Subnet**: Select which subnet(s) you want to validate for
4. **Stake Tokens**: Lock the required stake amount for your chosen subnet
5. **Start Validating**: Begin evaluating miner submissions and earn rewards

### Validator Rewards

- Base rewards for participating in validation
- Performance bonuses for high-accuracy validation
- Delegation income from stakers
- Subnet-specific incentives
