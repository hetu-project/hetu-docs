## Three Key Elements of Hetu Ecosystem Governance

### Decision-Making by HETU Holders
HETU holders stake their tokens to gain voting weight, enabling them to participate in on-chain voting for proposals such as protocol upgrades and fee adjustments.
Decisions require meeting a minimum participation threshold (e.g., 20% of the circulating supply).
### Tiered Proposal Mechanism
Technical Optimization: Community voting.
Fund Allocation: Committee review.
Security Incidents: Rapid response by validators.
### Governance Reward Binding
Participants share governance rewards, based on their voting weight.
Key proposals that pass trigger HETU deflationary burns.


## Token Roles and Positioning
### ETH (Ethereum Native Token)
**Core Use Cases**:
- Gas Fee Payments: Users can directly pay transaction and contract execution fees on Hetu Chain using ETH.
Cross-Chain Base Asset: ETH can be converted into pegged assets (e.g., hETH) via the standard cross-chain bridge for circulation within the ecosystem.

**User Value**:
- Zero Learning Curve: Ethereum users can experience the Hetu ecosystem without needing to acquire new tokens.
Liquidity Reuse: ETH can directly participate in Hetu Chain’s DeFi, NFT, and other scenarios without additional conversions.


### HETU (Ecosystem Governance Token)
**Core Use Cases**:

- Decentralized Governance: Holders can vote on critical decisions such as protocol upgrades and fee parameter adjustments.
- Network Staking: Validator nodes are required to stake HETU to participate in consensus, and users can earn rewards by delegating their stakes.

**User Value**:

- Governance Influence: Voting weight is proportional to token holdings, allowing deep participation in the ecosystem’s development direction.
- Long-Term Revenue Capture: Users can share in network transaction fee revenue and block rewards through staking.
