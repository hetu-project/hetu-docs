## Hetu Ecosystem
Hetu is a modular, multi-chain blockchain ecosystem designed to provide developers with efficient and low-cost solutions for building application chains, while offering users a seamless multi-chain interaction experience. Through layered design and resource sharing, Hetu achieves an optimal balance between security and scalability.

## Core Architecture
#### Layered Model

1. **Hetu Main Chain**:
- Function: Manages validator nodes, handles cross-chain consensus, and generates state snapshots (Checkpoints) periodically anchored to Ethereum.
- Features: Supports thousands of transactions per second (TPS) and is compatible with EVM smart contracts.

2. **APP Chains (Application Chains)**:
- Function:  Developers can build vertical scenario-specific chains (e.g., gaming chains, DeFi chains, enterprise chains) with fully customizable business rules.
- Features: Zero node maintenance costs, leveraging the main chain’s shared security and cross-chain protocols.
  
#### Cross-Chain Components
- Standardized Cross-Chain Bridge: Enables two-way circulation of ETH and ecosystem assets, completing cross-chain operations in 3 minutes.
- Checkpoint Mechanism: Anchors the main chain’s critical state to Ethereum every 30 minutes, ensuring censorship resistance and traceability.

## Dual-Token Economy
**Synergy Logic**:
ETH drives daily transactions, lowering user barriers.
HETU captures long-term ecosystem value, ensuring decentralized governance.

## Developer Advantages
1. **Simplified Development**
- Modular Toolkit: Offers pre-built consensus modules, asset bridging templates, and data indexing services, saving 90% of underlying development time.
- Flexible Customization: Developers can define gas rules, storage structures, and privacy policies to meet diverse scenario needs.
2. **Low-Cost Launch**
- Shared Validators: Developers can leverage Hetu’s global validator network without recruiting or maintaining nodes.
- Free Cross-Chain Integration: Built-in standardized cross-chain protocols enable instant interoperability between application chain assets and ETH.

## User Experience
1. **Unified Entry Point**
- Single Wallet Management: Users can manage all application chain assets through wallets like MetaMask.
- Cross-Chain Transparency: The system automatically handles cross-chain operations, providing a single-chain-like experience.
2. **Cost Advantages**
- 80% Lower Gas Fees: Significantly reduced transaction costs compared to Ethereum mainnet.
- Multi-Currency Payments: Supports ETH or HETU for gas fees, with real-time recommendations for the optimal option.
  
## Governance Mechanism
- **On-Chain Voting**: HETU holders stake tokens to participate in proposal decisions, including parameter adjustments and ecosystem fund usage.
- **Tiered Response**:
  -  Regular Proposals : Community voting (7-day cycle, 20% circulating supply participation required).
  - Emergency Proposals: 
  - Rapid response by the validator committee (e.g., security fixes, effective within 2 hours).
- **Incentive Binding**: Proposal initiators and voters share rewards from the governance pool based on contributions.
  
## Ecosystem Vision
**Hetu aims to become the infrastructure layer of the Web3 era by**:

- Lowering Blockchain Development Barriers: Enabling developers to build application chains as easily as creating websites.
- Breaking Chain Barriers: Allowing users to explore the multi-chain world without technical concerns.
- Democratizing Value: Ensuring fair distribution of ecosystem benefits through decentralized governance.
