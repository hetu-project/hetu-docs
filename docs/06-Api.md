## HETU API

The JSON-PRC Server provides an API that allows you to connect to the Hetu blockchain and interact with the EVM. This gives you direct access to reading Ethereum-formatted transactions or sending them to the network which otherwise wouldn't be possible on a Cosmos chain, such as Hetu chain.
