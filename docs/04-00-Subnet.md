# Hetu Subnet

## Overview

Hetu is an open-source decentralized platform that enables participants to collaborate in producing high-quality digital commodities across various domains, including:

- **Compute Power** - Distributed computing resources
- **Artificial Intelligence** - AI inference and training services
- **Protein Folding** - Scientific computation for biological research
- **Financial Market Prediction** - Market analysis and forecasting
- **And many more** - Extensible to various digital commodity types

## Architecture

Hetu is structured as a network of interconnected **subnets**, where each subnet operates as an autonomous community with its own specialized focus:

- **Independent Operation** - Each subnet functions as a self-governing ecosystem
- **Specialized Communities** - Subnets focus on specific types of digital commodities
- **Decentralized Governance** - Community-driven decision making within each subnet

## Network Participants

The Hetu network consists of four key participant types, each playing a crucial role in the ecosystem:

### Subnet Creators
- **Role**: Design and manage subnet-specific incentive mechanisms
- **Contribution**: Define work specifications and evaluation criteria
- **Responsibility**: Maintain fair and effective reward systems
- **Learn More**: [Create a Subnet](Subnet-Registration-Guide.md)

### Miners
- **Role**: Produce digital commodities and provide computational resources
- **Contribution**: Generate value through specialized work and services
- **Incentives**: Earn Hetu tokens  based on the quality and value of their contributions
- **Learn More**: [Mining in Hetu](04-03-Mining.md)

### Validators
- **Role**: Evaluate and validate the quality of miners' work
- **Contribution**: Ensure network integrity by assessing output quality
- **Incentives**: Receive rewards for accurate validation work
- **Learn More**: [Validating in Hetu](04-04-Validating.md)


### Stakers
- **Role**: Support network security by staking Hetu tokens
- **Contribution**: Delegate tokens to trusted validators
- **Benefits**: Earn passive rewards while strengthening network security
- **Learn More**: [Staking](04-02-Staking-Delegation.md)

## Token Economics

The Hetu network operates on a continuous reward distribution model:

- **Native Token**: Hetu Token (Ï„ - "tau")
- **Distribution Method**: Proportional rewards based on value contribution
- **Reward Mechanism**: Automatic and continuous token emission
- **Value Alignment**: Rewards are directly tied to the quality and impact of contributions

## How to Participate

### Getting Started

You can join the Hetu network in multiple ways:

1. **As a Subnet Creator** - Launch your own specialized subnet community
2. **As a Staker** - Support the network by delegating tokens to validators
3. **As a Miner** - Contribute computational resources and produce digital commodities
4. **As a Validator** - Join an existing subnet to evaluate miners' work
  



### Development Tools

The Hetu ecosystem provides comprehensive tooling for developers and participants:

- **[Hetu CLI](05-00-CLI.md)** - Command-line interface for network interaction
- **[Hetu SDK](05-01-SDK.md)** - Software development kit for building applications
